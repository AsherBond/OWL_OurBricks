Tasks
-----
Create a GUI (Swing wonderland app) for the search.
  - Going with a HUD for now; if it does not work will go back to a Swing app
    - Add tasks here for later

Search:
Limiting the search to 5 results. If there are more, the field next_start will
have an integer value so we can use that to enable the 'Next' button.

Tests
-----
Make sense of the use of Mocks for the connection to the web server.


WorkFlow out of Wonderland: To make things easier, instead of deploying every
single change to an OWL server I am running the JPanel on its own using the
class:
java -cp .:../../lib/gson-1.7.1.jar
org/jdesktop/wonderland/modules/ourbricks/client/TestJPanelExecutable

from the build/classes directory.
