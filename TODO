WorkFlow out of Wonderland: To make things easier, instead of deploying every
single change to an OWL server I am running the JPanel on its own using the
class:
java -cp .:../../lib/gson-1.7.1.jar
org/jdesktop/wonderland/modules/ourbricks/client/TestJPanelExecutable

from the build/classes directory.
